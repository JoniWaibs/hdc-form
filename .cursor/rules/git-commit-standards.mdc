# Git Commit and Changelog Standards

## Commit Messages
- Always use a single line for commit messages
- Follow the format: `type: brief description of changes`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Keep the total message length under 72 characters
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Do not end with a period

## Changelog Management
- Update CHANGELOG.md before every push
- Add changes under the [Unreleased] section
- Group changes by type:
  - Added: for new features
  - Changed: for changes in existing functionality
  - Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features
  - Removed: for removed features
  - Fixed: for bug fixes
  - Security: for security fixes
  - Technical: for technical changes
  - Test: for tests features changes or fixes

## Examples
Good commit messages:
- `feat: add user authentication system`
- `fix: resolve cache invalidation issue`
- `refactor: improve resource cards layout`

Bad commit messages:
- `updated some stuff...`
- `fix bug in the code.`
- `feat: implemented new authentication system and added user roles plus email verification`
